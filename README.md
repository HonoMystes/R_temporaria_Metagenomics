# R_temporaria_Metagenomics
Scripts used for my thesis project on the metagenomic analysis of Rana temporaria gut microbiota

At the moment the current scripts and files are:

- The *demu.sh* script for demultiplexing and cutadapt;  
- The *FeatureTablecreation.sh* script to filter, denoise and create de feature tables to be used for the taxonomic, phylogenetic and diversity analysis;
- The *ConfigFile.yml* the configuration file to be used in the other scripts (at the moment only the FeatureTablecreation.sh is using this file);
- The License and the file you are currently reading the README file. 

This project is being done by Daniela Deodato year 2025.
