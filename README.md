# R_temporaria_Metagenomics
Scripts used for my thesis project on the metagenomic analysis of Rana temporaria gut microbiota

At the moment the current scripts and files are:

- The *demu.sh* script for importing the data into artifact type and cutting the primers with cutadapt.  
- The *FeatureTablecreation.sh* script to filter, denoise, filter out chimeras and create de feature tables and representative sequences to be used for the taxonomic, phylogenetic and diversity analysis.

- The *ConfigFile.yml* the configuration file to be used in the other scripts.
